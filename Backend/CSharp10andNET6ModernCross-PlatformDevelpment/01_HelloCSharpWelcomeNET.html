                In this first chapter, the goals are setting up your development environment, understanding
                the similarities and differences between modern .NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono,
                Xamarin, and .NET Standard, creating the simplest application possible with C# 10 and .NET 6
                using various code editors, and then discovering good places to look for help.

                The GitHub repository for this book has solutions using full application projects for all code
                tasks and notebooks when possible:

                Throughout this book, I use the term modern .NET to refer to .NET 6 and its predecessors like
                .NET 5 that come from .NET Core. I use the term legacy .NET to refer to .NET Framework,
                Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard. Modern .NET is a unification of those legacy platforms
                and standards.

            <p>
                Before you start programming, you'll need a code editor for C#. Microsoft has a family of code
                editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

                You can make the argument that the best tool is the one you are already
                familiar with or that you or your team will use as your daily development tool. For that reason,
                I want you to be free to choose any C# code editor or IDE to complete the coding tasks in this

                I believe the best method for learning the C# and .NET topics in Chapters 1 to
                12 is to build console applications. Then, in Chapter 13 to 19 onward, you will build websites,
                services, and graphical desktop and mobile apps.

                .NET 6, .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin are related and overlapping platforms for
                developers used to build applications and services. In this section, I'm going to introduce you

            <h2 class="contenedor__titulos--h2">1.2.1 Understanding .NET Framework</h2>
            <p>
                .NET Framework is a development platform that includes a Common Language Runtime
                (CLR), which manages the execution of code, and a Base Class Library (BCL), which provides
                a rich library of classes to build applications from.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Microsoft originally designed .NET Framework to have the possibility of being cross-platform,
                but Microsoft put their implementation effort into making it work best with Windows.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                .NET Framework is installed
                on over one billion computers, so it must change as little as possible. Even bug fixes can cause
                problems, so it is updated infrequently.

            <p>
                Third parties developed a .NET Framework implementation named the Mono project. Mono is
                cross-platform, but it fell well behind the official implementation of .NET Framework.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Mono has found a niche as the foundation of the Xamarin mobile platform as well as crossplatform
                game development platforms like Unity.

            <br>
            <p>
                Microsoft purchased Xamarin in 2016 and now gives away what used to be an expensive
                Xamarin extension for free with Visual Studio. Microsoft renamed the Xamarin Studio
                development tool, which could only create mobile apps, to Visual Studio for Mac and gave
                it the ability to create other types of projects like console apps and web services.

                Visual Studio 2022 for Mac was also rewritten to be a truly native macOS UI app to improve reliability

            <p>
                Today, we live in a truly cross-platform world where modern mobile and cloud development
                have made Windows, as an operating system, much less important. Because of that, Microsoft
                has been working on an effort to decouple .NET from its close ties with Windows. While
                rewriting .NET Framework to be truly cross-platform, they've taken the opportunity to refactor
                and remove major parts that are no longer considered core.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Most improvements that Microsoft makes to .NET Core and modern .NET cannot be

                For example, if you had created a project using .NET Core 3.0, then when Microsoft released
                .NET Core 3.1 in December 2019, you had to upgrade your project to .NET Core 3.1 by March
                2020.

            <p>
                .NET Runtime versioning follows semantic versioning, that is, a major increment indicates
                breaking changes, minor increments indicate new features, and patch increments indicate bug
                fixes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                .NET SDK versioning does not follow semantic versioning. The major and minor version
                numbers are tied to the runtime version it is matched with. The patch number follows a
                convention that indicates the major and minor versions of the SDK.

                Modern .NET is modularized. It is open source and Microsoft makes decisions about improvements and changes in the open.

            <p>
                One of the features of modern .NET is support for running old Windows Forms and WPF
                applications using the Windows Desktop Pack that is included with the Windows version of
                .NET Core 3.1 or later, which is why it is bigger than the SDKs for macOS and Linux.

            <p>
                ASP.NET Web Forms and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) are old web
                application and service technologies that fewer developers are choosing to use for new
                development projects today, so they have also been removed from modern .NET. Instead,
                developers prefer to use ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, SignalR, and gRPC. These
                technologies have been refactored and combined into a platform that runs on modern .NET,
                named ASP.NET Core.

            <p>
                The situation with .NET in 2019 was that there were three forked .NET platforms controlled by
                Microsoft, as shown in the following list:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>.NET Core:</b> For cross-platform and new apps
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>.NET Framework:</b> For legacy apps
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Xamarin:</b> For mobile apps
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each had strengths and weaknesses because they were all designed for different scenarios. This
                led to the problem that a developer had to learn three platforms, each with annoying quirks
                and limitations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because of that, Microsoft defined .NET Standard &#45; a specification for a set of APIs that all .NET
                platforms could implement to indicate what level of compatibility they have.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With the release of .NET 6 in November 2021, the need for .NET Standard has reduced
                significantly because there is now a single .NET for all platforms, including mobile.

            <h2 class="contenedor__titulos--h2">1.2.9 Understanding intermediate language</h2>
            <p>
                The C# compiler (named Roslyn) used by the dotnet CLI tool converts your C# source code
                into intermediate language (IL) code and stores the IL in an assembly (a DLL or EXE file). IL
                code statements are like assembly language instructions, which are executed by .NET's virtual
                machine, known as CoreCLR.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At runtime, CoreCLR loads the IL code from the assembly, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler
                compiles it into native CPU instructions, and then it is executed by the CPU on your machine.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The benefit of this two-step compilation process is that Microsoft can create CLRs for Linux
                and macOS, as well as for Windows.
